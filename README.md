## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on background styles, image transform effects and copying desired design.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Create background images with background color merged

## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background images and give positions for desktop and mobile screens
3. Create card wrapper div
4. Add wrapper background image, user image and text
5. Give images their sizes and styles in CSS
6. Create horizontal line with CSS styles
7. Give texts and numbers font styles in CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Transform
- Media Queries

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using CSS for making interesting and responsive background of a page, the main challenge that I overcame was to position two background images as they were given in the design, with background color behind them. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the CSS code using "Transform" to position images and "Media Queries" to make page responsive. That worked out eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding, to make more dynamic, interactive and responsive projects
